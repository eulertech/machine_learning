Good afternoon,

Attached is a pdf document highlighting the benefits and some risks of establishing a WiFi infrastructure for OCS on the 6th and 7th floors of SSMC3.  Please take a look and offer suggestions to make a stronger business case for this proposal.  We will have an opportunity to discuss on Thursday at our Idea Team meeting.

Thank you,

Neil
